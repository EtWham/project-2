# project-2

Project Summary:

Our goal is to create a social media site in a classroom setting that enables students to post questions and responses.

Students will create user profiles and take surveys that indicate each student's strengths and weaknesses within a particular subject area. Once the surveys are completed, users with weaknesses within a certain area will be paired with users that have strengths in those very same areas. Afterwards, a chatroom will be created for those students to discuss weaknesses.  

After the learning session is completed students will be able to rate the tutors and vice versa.
